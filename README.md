## PacMan
This project delves into the idea of page bounds and replacing images based on directio of travel.  Initially PacMan is moving to the right, alternating between open and closed mouth images. Upon hitting the right page bound, PacMan will reverse direction, swaping images for left facing PacMan, and proceed to move across the page to the left, until hitting the opposite page bound.  This also allowed us to test the use of setInterval to automate the movement.


## Usage
To run this project, clone the repo to your local machine and open index.html.  This will open the program in your local browser.

## Future Enhancements
* Add multiple PacMen
* Add change direction on click
